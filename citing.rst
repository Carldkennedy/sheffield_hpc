   The University of Sheffield has invested circa Â£3M in providing
   a state of the art High Performance Compute cluster, Stanage,
   to meet the computational requirements of its researchers.

   Stanage complements the two existing HPCs (ShARC & Bessemer), and provides
   a large increase in CPU compute cores (~12,000),
   and high performance GPUs (64 A100s & 12 H100s).
   Researchers will leverage this in-house resource to
   pursue advanced research in ML/AI, NLP, engineering applications and many other areas
   and advance the University's status as a top flight research institution.

   In addition, through the University of Sheffield researchers can
   access and get local Research Software Engineer support for
   the Bede and JADE2 'tier 2' (regional) GPU-equipped HPC systems.
   Bede has 32 GPU-equipped worker nodes, each with 4 V100 GPUs
   and JADE2 has 63 worker nodes, each with 8 V100 GPUs.
