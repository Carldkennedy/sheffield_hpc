Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
==========================================

.. sidebar:: GDAL

   :Latest version: 2.1.1
   :URL: http://www.gdal.org/

GDAL is a library used by many Geographic Information Systems (GIS) packages for converting between many different raster and vector GIS data formats.  It also includes command-line utilities for data translation and processing.  It is released under an an X/MIT style Open Source license by the `Open Source Geospatial Foundation <http://www.osgeo.org>`_.

Usage
-----

By running ::

    $ module load libs/gcc/6.2/proj/2.1.1

you

* add several GDAL programs to your ``PATH`` environment variable
* allow other programs to make use of (dynamically link against) the GDAL library

You can run ``gdal-config --version`` to test that you are running the required version ::

    $ gdal-config --version
    2.1.1

The command-line programs that GDAL provides are ::

* ``gdaladdo``
* `gdalbuildvrt``
* `gdal-config``
* `gdal_contour``
* `gdaldem``
* `gdalenhance``
* `gdal_grid``
* `gdalinfo``
* `gdallocationinfo``
* `gdalmanage``
* `gdal_rasterize``
* `gdalserver``
* `gdalsrsinfo``
* `gdaltindex``
* `gdaltransform``
* `gdal_translate``
* `gdalwarp``
* `nearblack``
* `ogr2ogr``
* `ogrinfo``
* `ogrlineref``
* `ogrtindex``
* `testepsg``

The ``gdal...`` utilities are mostly for processing raster GIS data formats, whilst the ``ogr...`` utilities are for processing vector GIS data formats.

Documentation
-------------
Standard ``man`` pages are available for the provided commands/functions.

These can be viewed using e.g. ::

    $ man gdal_contour

Much more information is available on the `project site <http://www.gdal.org/>`_.

Supported file formats
----------------------

GDAL has been compiled on this system with support for only a limited set of GIS data formats.  See **Installation notes** below for a list of those provided by each available version of GDAL.

Installation notes
------------------
This section is primarily for administrators of the system.

**Version 2.1.1**

GDAL 2.1.1 was compiled with v6.2.0 of the GCC compiler suite.

#. ``cd`` to a scratch directory.
#. Download, build and install GDAL using :download:`install.sh </iceberg/software/install_scripts/libs/gcc/6.2/gdal/2.1.1/install.sh>`, ensuring that all output is redirected into a log file.  GDAL files are installed into ``/usr/local/packages6/libs/gcc/6.2/gdal/2.1.1/``
#. Install :download:`this modulefile </iceberg/software/modulefiles/libs/gcc/6.2/gdal/2.1.1>` as ``/usr/local/modulefiles/libs/gcc/6.2/gdal/2.1.1``

The **file formats** supported by the build generated using ``install.sh`` are listed :download:`here </iceberg/software/install_scripts/libs/gcc/6.2/gdal/2.1.1/configure_output.log>`.
