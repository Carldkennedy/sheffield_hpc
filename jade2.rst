JADE II (Tier 2 GPU cluster)
=========================

The JADE II cluster is a 2020 renewal of the `Joint Academic Data Science Endeavour (JADE) <https://www.jade.ac.uk>`_ maintaing its status as the largest GPU facility in the UK supporting world-leading research in machine learning.

The computational hub harnesses the capabilities of the **NVIDIA DGX MAX-Q** Deep Learning System and comprise of **63 servers**, each containing **8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs** linked by NVIDIAâ€™s NV link interconnect technology. The MAX-Q range are a more power-efficient system allowing the doubling of computational power of JADE with only 2/3 of power that would have been required.

The `RSE`_ group director (Paul Richmond) is a co-investigator in the EPSRC Tier 2 JADE II system. As such members of the University of Sheffield are able to access this resource for free (for use with deep learning research).

.. note::
    The system is expected to be launched and accessible to researchers by the end of 2020.
