Getting an Account
==================

Before you can start using the clusters you need to register for an HPC account.

An account gives you access to all our clusters (Bessemer and ShARC).

Accounts are available for staff by emailing `helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

The following categories of students can also have an account with
the permission of their supervisors:

* Research Postgraduates
* Taught Postgraduates - project work
* Undergraduates 3rd & 4th year  - project work

A student's supervisor can request an account for the student by emailing
`helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

.. note::

   You must not share your account credentials or allow others to run jobs using your account. 
   Any misuse of accounts will be investigated in accordance with 
   the University of Sheffield's `IT Code of Practice <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/codeofpractice/core>`__.

.. note::

   The High Performance Computing service should not be used to store or process sensitive information for 
   example personal information, financial data, commercially sensitive or any other form of restricted data 
   without first discussing your requirements with the Research IT Team - research-it@sheffield.ac.uk 

   Extra care should always be taken when dealing with sensitive information; if you are in any doubt about 
   the sensitivity of information, or how it should be handled, then please contact the IT Services 
   `helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk <helpdesk@sheffield.ac.uk>`_ for advice.
