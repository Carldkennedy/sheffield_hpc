   :Documentation: https://docs.octeract.com/

Octeract Engine is a massively parallel MINLP solver. It is written in ORL (Octeract Reformulation Language).

The engine contains 14 Octeract solvers for different types of mathematical structure, 
each with their own algorithms, to a grand total of 1031 high-performance algorithms.

Octeract Engine supports the :ref:`Python <sharc-python-conda>`, C++ and Julia programming languages 
alongside several modelling languages such as AMPL, PYOMO, JuMP, GAMS and Mosel.

Usage
-----

Octeract Engine 3.1.0 can be loaded by module loading with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    module load octeract-engine/3.1.0/binary


Interactive jobs
----------------

After connecting to Bessemer (see :ref:`ssh`), Octeract Engine can be used interactively by starting an :ref:`interactive session <submit-interactive>` with ``srun --pty bash -i`` 
and then issuing the commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    module load octeract-engine/3.1.0/binary
    octeract-engine /usr/local/packages/live/noeb/octeract-engine/3.1.0/binary/examples/nl/ex2_1_1.nl -n8 -d ${PWD}


Batch jobs
----------

Octeract Engine can be used in both :ref:`SMP<parallel_SMP>` (single node only) and 
:ref:`MPI<parallel_MPI>` parallel environments - on Bessemer no parallel environment needs specifiying.
